    "1. `log` - Log from which the sample was extracted.\n",
    "2. `sample` - An annotated camera image with an associated timestamp and past and future images and pointclouds.\n",
    "3. `sample_data` - An image or pointcloud associated with a sample.\n",
    "4. `ego_pose` - The vehicle ego pose and timestamp associated with a sample_data.\n",
    "5. `sensor` - General information about a sensor, e.g. `CAM_BACK_LEFT`.\n",
    "6. `calibrated_sensor` - Calibration information of a sensor in a log.\n",
    "7. `category` - Taxonomy of object and surface categories (e.g. `vehicle.car`, `flat.drivable_surface`). \n",
    "8. `attribute` - Property of an object that can change while the category remains the same.\n",
    "9. `object_ann` - Bounding box and mask annotation of an object (e.g. car, adult).\n",
    "10. `surface_ann` - Mask annotation of a surface (e.g. `flat.driveable surface` and `vehicle.ego`)."

Rather, the class implements lazy loading that overwrites the internal `__getattr__()` function to load a table if it is not already stored in memory. The moment we accessed `category`, we could see the table being loaded from disk. To disable such notifications, just set `verbose=False` when initializing the NuImages object. Furthermore lazy loading can be disabled with `lazy=False`."
