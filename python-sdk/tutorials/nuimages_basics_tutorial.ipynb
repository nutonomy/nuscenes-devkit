    "\n",
    "1. `image` - An annotated camera image with an associated timestamp.\n",
    "2. `log` - Log information from which the image was extracted.\n",
    "3. `camera` - Information about the camera the image was taken from. Intrinsic parameters will be added in future releases.\n",
    "4. `category` - Taxonomy of object and surface categories (e.g. vehicle.car, flat.drivable_surface). \n",
    "5. `attribute` - Property of an object that can change while the category remains the same.\n",
    "6. `object_ann` - Bounding box and mask annotation of an object (e.g. car, adult).\n",
    "7. `surface_ann` - Mask annotation of a surface (e.g. driveable surface and ego vehicle)."

Rather, the class implements lazy loading that overwrites the internal `__getattr__()` function to load a table if it is not already stored in memory. The moment we accessed `category`, we could see the table being loaded from disk. To disable such notifications, just set `verbose=False` when initializing the NuImages object. Furthermore lazy loading can be disabled with `lazy=False`."
