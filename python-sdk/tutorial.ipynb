Looking at the schema you will notice that the `map` table has a `log_token` field, but that the `log` table does not have a corresponding `map_token` field. But there are plenty of situations where you have a log, and want to find the corresponding map! So what to do? You can always use the `nusc.field2token()` method, but that is slow and inconvenient. We therefore add reverse mappings for some common situations including this one.\n",

    "Consider, for example, the category name (e.g. `human.pedestrian`) of a `sample_annotation`. The `sample_annotation` table doesn't hold this information since the category is an instance level constant. Instead the `sample_annotation` table points to a record in the `instance` table. This, in turn, points to a record in the `category` table, where finally the `name` fields stores the required information. Since it is quite common to want to know the category name of an annotation, we add a `category_name` field to the `sample_annotation` table during initialization of the NuScenes class.\n",
