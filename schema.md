Database schema
==========
category
---------

Taxonomy of object categories (e.g. vehicle, human). 
Subcategories are delineated by a period (e.g. human.pedestrian.adult).
```
category {
   "token":                   <str> -- Unique record identifier.
   "name":                    <str> -- Category name. Subcategories indicated by period.
   "description":             <str> -- Category description.
}
```
attribute
---------

An attribute is a property of an instance that can change while the category remains the same. 
 Example: a vehicle being parked/stopped/moving, and whether or not a bicycle has a rider.
```
attribute {
   "token":                   <str> -- Unique record identifier.
   "name":                    <str> -- Attribute name.
   "description":             <str> -- Attribute description.
}
```
visibility
---------

should be very close to the sample it points to. For non key-frames the sample_data points to the 
sample that follows closest in time.

   "attribute_tokens":        <str> [n] -- Foreign keys. List of attributes for this annotation. Attributes can change over time, so they belong here, not in the object table.
   "visibility_token":        <str> -- Foreign key. Visibility may also change over time. If no visibility is annotated, the token is an empty string.
   "translation":             <float> [3] -- Bounding box location as center_x, center_y, center_z.
   "size":                    <float> [3] -- Bounding box size as width, length, height.

   "num_lidar_pts":           <int> -- Number of lidar points in this box. Points are counted during the lidar sweep identified with this sample.
   "num_radar_pts":           <int> -- Number of radar points in this box. Points are counted during the radar sweep identified with this sample. This number is summed across all radar sensors without any invalid point filtering.
   "next":                    <str> -- Foreign key. Sample annotation from the same object instance that follows this in time. Empty if this is the last annotation for this object.
   "prev":                    <str> -- Foreign key. Sample annotation from the same object instance that precedes this in time. Empty if this is the first annotation for this object.
