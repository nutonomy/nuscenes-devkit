# nuScenes dev-kit
Welcome to the dev-kit of the [nuScenes](https://nuscenes.org) dataset.

## Dataset download
To download nuScenes you need to go to the [Download page](https://nuscenes.org/download), 
create an account and confirm the nuScenes [Terms of Use](https://nuscenes.org/terms-of-use).
After logging in you will see multiple archives for images, pointclouds and meta data. 
For the devkit to work you will need to download *all* archives.
Please unpack the archives to the `/data/nuscenes` folder \*without\* overwriting folders that occur in multiple archives.
Eventually you should have the following folder structure:
```
/data/nuscenes
    maps	-	Large image files (~500 Gigapixel) that depict the drivable surface and sidewalks in the scene
    samples	-	Sensor data for keyframes
    sweeps	-	Sensor data for intermediate frames
    v0.1	-	JSON tables that include all the meta data and annotations
```
If you want to use another folder, specify the `dataroot` parameter of the NuScenes class below.

## Devkit setup
Download the devkit to your home directory using:
```
cd && git clone https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit.git
```
The dev-kit is tested for Python 3.7. 
We may add backward compatibility in future releases.
To install the required packages, run the following command in your favourite virtual environment. If you need help in 
installing Python3.7 or in setting up a new virtual environment, you can look at [these instructions](#setup-new-virtual-environment):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Also add the `python-sdk` directory to your `PYTHONPATH` environmental variable, e.g. by adding the 
following to your `~/.bashrc`:
```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$HOME/nuscenes-devkit/python-sdk"
```

## Getting started
To get started with the nuScenes devkit, please run the tutorial as an IPython notebook:
```
jupyter notebook $HOME/nuscenes-devkit/python-sdk/tutorial.ipynb
```
In case you want to avoid downloading and setting up the data, you can also take a look at the same notebook on 
[Github](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/python-sdk/tutorial.ipynb).

## Setup new virtual environment

It is recommended to install the devkit in a new virtual environment. Here are the steps you can follow to create one:

#### Python 3.7 installation

If you don't have Python 3.7 on your system, you can use the following steps to install it.

UBUNTU:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.7
```

MACOS: Download from `https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/` and install.

#### Install virtualenvwrapper
```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```
Add these two lines to `~/.bashrc` (`~/.bash_profile` on MACOS) to set the location where the virtual environments 
should live and the location of the script installed with this package:
```
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
source [VIRTUAL_ENV_LOCATION]
```
Replace `[VIRTUAL_ENV_LOCATION]` with either `/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh` or `~/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh` 
depending on where it is installed on your system.

After editing it, reload the shell startup file by running e.g. `source ~/.bashrc`.

#### Create the virtual environment
```
mkvirtualenv nuscenes --python [PYTHON_BINARIES] 
```
PYTHON_BINARIES are typically at either `/usr/local/bin/python3.7` or `/usr/bin/python3.7`.
